# GatewayGuard — Claude Code Project Instructions
<!-- Dated: 2026-07-25 15:30 ET -->

## Project Identity

- **Product:** GatewayGuard — Windows 11 security hardening tool for non-technical home users
- **Developer:** Solo (William F. Burns III / GatewayGuard LLC)
- **Target launch:** September 1, 2026
- **Current build:** ascii28 (4,866 lines) — always confirm current build number before any edit session
- **Language:** Python (primary tool), PowerShell (.ps1 for system edits), batch (.bat for launchers)
- **Platform:** Windows 11 Home and Pro only

---

## Build Naming Rules

- Build names follow the convention: ascii11, ascii12, ascii13 … (incrementing integer after "ascii")
- **Never reuse a build number.** Every saved output is a new build number.
- Same-day superseding builds still increment (e.g., ascii26 superseded same night by ascii27 — both exist)
- Always state the new build number explicitly before presenting output

---

## Pre-Build Checklist (run before presenting any .py output)

1. Audit source for **duplicate function definitions** — flag every duplicate found before proceeding
2. Confirm all `.ps1` edits use **assert-guarded Python replacements** (no raw PowerShell string edits without assertion)
3. Confirm **`-join`** is used, not `Join-String` (PowerShell 5.1 compatibility)
4. Confirm **console flags are re-asserted before every read**, not once at startup
5. Confirm **ASCII conversion replaces all Unicode characters** before output
6. Confirm build number has been incremented from the previous build
7. Confirm all screens have pauses and a **Back option at every prompt**
8. Confirm no accidental exit without confirmation dialog

---

## Coding Standards

### PowerShell / .ps1
- Use `-join` not `Join-String` (PS 5.1 compatibility — target machines may not have PS 7)
- All `.ps1` edits must go through assert-guarded Python wrappers — never edit registry or system settings via raw string manipulation
- Console flags must be re-asserted before every read operation (not once at startup — see FT-63: Mark mode pauses execution on writes)

### Python
- Build from a clean known-good base — never patch a patched file without confirming the base
- Run the pre-build checklist above before presenting any file
- ASCII conversion must replace **all** Unicode characters before output

### General
- No self-elevation in the launcher (Malwarebytes flagged self-elevation as exploit payload — do not reintroduce)
- Tool version is always **v3.0** in all user-facing text
- For personal computers only — do not generalize to enterprise or server scenarios

---

## Product Rules (User-Facing)

- Only name approved AV products by name: **Microsoft Defender (USA)** and **Malwarebytes Free (USA)**
- Always include country of origin for AV recommendations
- Never name unapproved or competitor products
- "For your protection, your choices can be reviewed in your log" — shown **once only**, on the review screen
- Use **"HEADS UP"** wording, not formal "NOTICE"
- Non-recommended warnings use **Y / N / S** options
- **BitLocker** is always the last item, on its own dedicated screen showing RAM + drive size + type + estimated time
- **GOOD items** auto-skip during run, offered for change at the end
- Font instructions shown as the **very first screen** before any code runs

---

## User-Facing Clarity Rule

Every instruction given to the user must state exactly what each action does and what happens if they do not take it.

- **Never** say "press X when done" if X and "done" mean different things depending on context
- Spell out the outcome of each key or choice explicitly
- **Test:** Could a non-technical home user predict exactly what will happen before they press the key?

**Standard copy tip wording (use verbatim across all three locations):**
> Tip: To copy text from this window -- press Alt+Space, then E, then M -- drag or use Shift+arrows to select -- press Enter to copy. Press Esc to exit without copying.

The three locations this tip appears:
1. Checklist legend line (always visible)
2. Before BitLocker prep screen
3. Resume flow line

---

## Screen / UX Standards

- All screens need pauses before proceeding
- Back option at every prompt — no dead ends
- No accidental exits without confirmation
- BitLocker screen must show: RAM size, drive size, drive type, estimated time
- GOOD items auto-skip during run; offered for review/change at the end

---

## Document Formatting Standards

*(Applies to any .docx, guide, plan, or report generated alongside the tool)*

- Minimum **14pt body font**
- **Garamond** for guides, plans, reports, GUI text
- **Arial 14pt** for console/PowerShell output only
- Table headers: black fill / white bold text / black borders
- Table cells: white background / black text / black single-line borders with padding
- No color shading anywhere
- Page breaks between major sections
- Black and white only — no color
- Footer on every page with key sequence rule

---

## Known Issues Log (do not reintroduce)

- **FT-63:** Console text-selection / Mark mode pauses program execution on writes — console flags must be re-asserted before every read
- **Malwarebytes flag:** Self-elevation in launcher flagged as exploit payload — launcher must not self-elevate
- **UX-01 through UX-11:** Logged UX issues — confirm none are reintroduced in any build
- **OBS-01 through OBS-03:** Field observations from Dell Latitude 5430 testing

---

## Approved Products Named in Tool

- Microsoft Defender (USA)
- Malwarebytes Free (USA)

## Domain / Business

- Domain: gatewayguard.com
- LLC: GatewayGuard LLC (Maine)
- Code-signing certificate required before launch (Sectigo or DigiCert, ~$200–400/yr)

---

## File Naming Convention

- Every file uses the format: `filename-YYYY-MM-DD.ext` with today's actual date
- Internal header must show date **and time** in US Eastern Time: `# Dated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM ET`
- Filename date and internal header date+time must always match — update both in the same edit, never one without the other
- When one file references another by exact filename (e.g., launcher referencing a build script), update that reference in the same response whenever the referenced filename changes
